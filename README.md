# Electron Transfer Theory

Our main aim in this computation is to incorporate a spatio-temporal inhomogenity in the Diffusion Constant. This significantly complicates the numerical solution, as now the differential operator also have a space-time convolution. This repository contains various file related the generalisation attempt.
