# Electron Transfer Theory

Our main aim in this computation is to incorporate a spatio-temporal inhomogenity in the Diffusion Constant. This significantly complicates the numerical solution, as now the differential operator also have a space-time convolution. This repository contains various file related the generalisation attempt.

## Files 

1. **File 1** contains the benchmarking of the results of Mitradip et al.
2. **File 2** contains incorpation of a space dependent markovian Diffusion Coefficient.
3. **File 3** is an attemot to further generalisation to include Non-Markovian Effects
